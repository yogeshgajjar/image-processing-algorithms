## Homographic Transformation & Image Stitching 

The Homographic transformation is a popular geo-referencing technique used worldwide for numerous applications in the field of image processing and computer vision. It is based on quite complex geometric and mathematic concepts, known as "homogeneous coordinates" and "projective planes" which essentially helps in the converting one image taken from a fixed frame of reference into different frame by changing its geometrical coordinates. One of the applications of Homographic Transformations is image stitching. This method takes different images taken from different camera frame and are merged together to generate a combined image that produces a panoramic effect.
