## Defect Detection 

Application of image processing also deals with defect detection, where given an image with defect, morphological operations on image also helps in detecting defects in the image. This is an add on application to the counting problem and the PCB analysis where any of the morphological operation is helpful in  reprocessing the image and finding the count of unique objects in the image. In this problem, preprocessing like shrinking and thinning is used which helps in extracting useful information from the image and helps in another algorithm to function easily.
