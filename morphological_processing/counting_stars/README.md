## Counting Objects 

In image processing, counting problem in image/video processing is the estimation of the number of objects in a still image or video frame. The morphological operations such as Shrinking, Thinning and Skeletonizing are one of the helpful methods to identify the number of objects in the image/series of images. It arises in many real-world applications including cell counting in microscopic images, monitoring crowds in surveillance systems, or in our case itâ€™s a problem of counting the baked products on the production lines. Some other applications include production lines develop to track identify and separate and count products and all sorts of objects in a bounded image area and provide fast and highly  accurate results.

## Output 

The star count as produced by the algorithm is given below. 

```
------Morphological Method for Star Counting------ 

Star of size: 1 with frequency: 8
Star of size: 2 with frequency: 50
Star of size: 3 with frequency: 21
Star of size: 4 with frequency: 11
Star of size: 5 with frequency: 11
Star of size: 6 with frequency: 5
Star of size: 7 with frequency: 3
Star of size: 8 with frequency: 1
Star of size: 9 with frequency: 2
Star of size: 10 with frequency: 3
Final star count : 115
